# CleanDataProject
Instructions

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

project.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called Q5.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
